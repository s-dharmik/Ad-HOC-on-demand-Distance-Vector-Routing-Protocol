# Ad-HOC-on-demand-Distance-Vector-Routing-Protocol

> Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector routing protocol referred to as AODV.
- It is a reactive routing system that provides dynamic and self-forming network connections between mobile ad-hoc networks nodes. Nodes only save information about their next-hop neighbours in AODV, and route information is only sent when a node needs to send a packet. This reduces the expense associated with maintaining routes in a quickly changing network environment, making it a preferred choice for many ad-hoc network applications.
