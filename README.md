# Ad-HOC-on-demand-Distance-Vector-Routing-Protocol

- Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector routing protocol referred to as AODV.
- It is a reactive routing system that provides dynamic and self-forming network connections between mobile ad-hoc networks nodes. Nodes only save information about their next-hop neighbours in AODV, and route information is only sent when a node needs to send a packet. This reduces the expense associated with maintaining routes in a quickly changing network environment, making it a preferred choice for many ad-hoc network applications.

# Installation

- Download/clone the source code provided into this repository.
- Download Contiki OS and run it into any linux distro server you are comfortable with.
> https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/wiki

Above link is for downloading contiki os code.

After that you simply need to run the below command to setup env:
> source /upb/groups/fg-ccs/public/share/nes/2018w/env.sh

This will help setup environment for contiki and cooja. 

Next we need to simply run the code using emulator where you can see the final packet tranferring and routing.

Thank you.
